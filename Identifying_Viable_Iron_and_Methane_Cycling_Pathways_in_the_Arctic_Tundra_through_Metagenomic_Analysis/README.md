#pmoa_c.R: plotting gene counts of major methane-oxidation genes for each microbial genera they were detected in.Furthermore, color coding by the sample-site they were taken from. 
#FeGenie_Output_Analysis.R: making heatmaps to show the what portion of the metagenome was represented be a unique st of iron redox genes. 
#made alternative plots which focused more on distribution of these genes amongst the 4 major sample sites.
