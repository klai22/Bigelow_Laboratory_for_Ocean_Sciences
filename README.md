#Undergrad. Researcher | Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences (Emerson Lab)                               09/2021-09/2022
	#Led an investigation which discovered microbial metabolisms linked to climate change through methane and iron redox. Characterized bodies of water most likely to promote a healthier atmosphere. 
	#Processed and visualized large-scale metagenomic and environmental data through R and FeGenie. 
	#Shadowed the Single Cell Genomics Center. Learned library prep and loading for DNA sequencing of SAGs. 
	#Collected microbial samples along the Damariscotta Rivera and presented on the deviance of virus and bacterial abundances from the average global ratio at the Sea Change Semester Symposium. 
	#Gave a presentation about viable cycling pathways in the Arctic tundra through metagenomic analyses at the joint Bigelow Laboratories & Colby College Marine Sciences Symposium.
